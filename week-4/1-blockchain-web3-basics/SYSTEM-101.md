# Systems 101

Central systems are doomed to be apocalyptical due to excessive power of abuse. Hence, the drive to use decentralized systems is inevitable.

In this context, a system is referred to as any software that aims to solve a problem.

## Centralized Systems

A centralized system is a structure in which one single entity (such as a server, organization, or authority) controls the entire operation. All decisions, data, and functions pass through this central point, making it the single source of truth and control.

- **Example**: Traditional banks, cloud storage providers (Google Drive), social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram), etc.

## Decentralized Systems

In decentralized systems, no single entity has control. Instead, the system operates through a network of participants (nodes) that work together. Each participant has equal authority and access to data, eliminating the need for a central point of control.

- **Example**: Blockchain technology, peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
