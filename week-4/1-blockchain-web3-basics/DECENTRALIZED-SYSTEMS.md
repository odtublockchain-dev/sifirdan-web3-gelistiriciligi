# Decentralized Systems

Decentralized systems are run by distributed nodes, meaning that many different computers run the logic of the same system. The information regarding nodes (e.g., IP, connection) and the maintained code are publicly available in decentralized systems, enabling verification by different nodes.

## **Pros of Decentralized Systems**

1. **No single point of failure**: If one node goes down, the system continues to operate through other nodes.
2. **Transparency**: All participants have access to the same information, reducing opportunities for manipulation.
3. **Censorship resistance**: No central authority can block or censor users.
4. **Security**: Information is distributed, reducing the risks of hacking and data breaches.
5. **User empowerment**: Participants have more control over their own data and assets.

## **Cons of Decentralized Systems**

1. **Efficiency**: Decision-making and consensus can be slow and resource-intensive, especially in large networks (e.g., blockchain mining).
2. **Governance**: Achieving agreement across all participants can be challenging, leading to slower adaptation and evolution of the system.
3. **Cost**: The distributed infrastructure and maintenance can be more costly and complex than centralized systems.
4. **Complexity**: Difficult to implement and understand for the average user due to the technical expertise required.

## **Use Cases**

- **Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin, Ethereum.
- **Blockchain technology**: Supply chain tracking, decentralized finance (DeFi), voting systems.
- **Decentralized storage**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), Filecoin.
- **Peer-to-peer networks**: BitTorrent, decentralized apps (DApps).
