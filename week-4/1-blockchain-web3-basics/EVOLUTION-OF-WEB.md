# Evolution of Web Technology

The internet technology invented in its early days is vastly different from what we use today. It has evolved tremendously, not only in terms of capabilities but also in its direction and purpose. Here is its progression:

## **The Birth of the World Wide Web**

The basic concept of the World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 to be used as an internal network in CERN. The initial purpose of the World Wide Web was to create a system that made internal file transfers easier. However, Tim soon realized his invention could be scaled and used globally.

## **Web 1.0**

Web 1.0 represents the initial phase of internet technology. During this era:

- Web pages were purely **read-only** and **static**.
- Interaction with websites was not possible.
- Software and web applications were hosted on dedicated servers (**on-premise**).

## **Web 2.0**

Web 2.0 marked a significant leap in web technology. During this phase:

- Web technologies evolved to allow users to **interact** with web applications.
- Users could **read** and **write** content on web applications.
- Infrastructure transitioned from **on-premise systems** to **cloud-hosted servers**.

## **Web 3.0**

Web 3.0, also known as the **Semantic Web**, introduced a revolutionary concept of internet technology. Key features of this era include:

- Users can **read**, **write**, and **execute** on the internet.
- Actions in Web 3.0 are verified and executed by **nodes in decentralized networks**, not by a single server or entity.
- The system is not owned by any single authority; instead, it is owned by the network nodes, ensuring that:
  - **Data is not owned by any central entity**.
  - Information is **distributed across users**.
