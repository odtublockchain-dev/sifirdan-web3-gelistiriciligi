# Centralized Systems

Central systems are run by on-premise servers (dedicated servers) or servers hosted on the cloud. They heavily rely on not revealing server-side information like IP or server connections and keeping the maintained code confidential to avoid security vulnerabilities.

## **Pros of Centralized Systems**

1. **Efficiency**: Since thereâ€™s a central point of control, decision-making is fast.
2. **Easy management**: Clear hierarchy and simpler governance make management straightforward.
3. **Cost-effective**: Easier to implement and maintain because of standard infrastructure.
4. **Accountability**: Easier to identify responsible parties when issues arise.

## **Cons of Centralized Systems**

1. **Single point of failure**: If the central server or authority is compromised, the entire system can fail.
2. **Control and censorship**: The central authority can control or restrict access to information or services.
3. **Data breaches**: Sensitive data is often stored in one place, making it vulnerable to large-scale hacks.
4. **Scalability**: As the number of users grows, central servers can become bottlenecked and require significant resources to scale.

## **Use Cases**

- **Financial systems**: Central banks, traditional payment processors like Visa, PayPal.
- **Cloud computing**: AWS, Microsoft Azure.
- **Social media**: Facebook, Twitter.
- **E-commerce**: Amazon, eBay.
