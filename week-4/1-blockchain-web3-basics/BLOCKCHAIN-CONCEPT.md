# Blockchain Concept

A blockchain is a decentralized database that consists of a series of verified blocks. Each block holds data, typically in the form of transactions, and is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a continuous “chain”.

_The structure of a block in a blockchain._

In computer science, a **node** refers to an element or component within a data structure. For simplicity, a node can be understood as a computer. These data structures consist of nodes (or computers) that are used to update and manage data.

A blockchain consists of **nodes distributed globally**, working together in real-time without a central authority, such as a “supernode,” to oversee data changes. All nodes are equal participants in the network, ensuring consistent performance regardless of which node is used to update the data. In essence, blockchains operate as **peer-to-peer networks**.
